                    <p>The RR is now even more focused and more precisely geared towards pure performance. For those who increasingly demand more. More from themselves. More each lap. And more from their RR. Simply put:<strong>#NeverStopChallenging</strong> . Leading the way is a matter of millimeters, especially in the circles the RR has always been a part of. That’s why we have streamlined and evolved the RR where it matters most: from the new steering angle sensor with Brake Slide Assist and Slide Control as well as the integration of M components and improvements to the electronics and crucial processes for modifying the bike for the race track. And all this with a clear goal in mind – claiming the pole position over and over again.</p>
